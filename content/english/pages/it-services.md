### What Are Managed IT Services?

Managed IT Services involve outsourcing the responsibility for your company’s IT systems to a trusted provider. Instead of reacting to technical problems as they arise, we work behind the scenes to ensure your systems run smoothly, securely, and efficiently at all times.

This includes:

- Monitoring and managing networks and servers
- Providing end-user support and helpdesk services
- Performing regular system maintenance and updates
- Managing cloud services and software platforms
- Supporting cybersecurity and compliance needs
- Planning for business continuity and disaster recovery
